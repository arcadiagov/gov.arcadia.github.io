        <p>About Arcadia

Arcadia is a sovereign micronation founded in 2019 as a monarchy. It was established to uphold the values of governance, order, and national unity.

Founding and Leadership
Arcadia was founded by its first High King, Dexter Welling, who laid the foundation for the nation’s government and traditions. Under his rule, the monarchy was established as the core of Arcadian governance.

The current High King, Mark Blakney, ascended to the throne and played a crucial role in shaping Arcadia’s future. He is the author of the Arcadian Constitution, which defines the nation's laws, government structure, and the rights of its citizens.
